I am a PhD student in Artificial Intellingence and Computer Science at the [University of Udine](https://www.uniud.it/en/), where I am affiliated with the Department of Mathematics, Computer Science and Physics ([DMIF](https://dmif.uniud.it/en)). I am also a member of the Motivational Digital Systems ([MoDiS](https://modis.fbk.eu/)) group at Fondazione Bruno Kessler ([FBK](https://www.fbk.eu/en/)).

My research mainly lies at the intersection of Adaptive Gamification and User Cognitive Modeling. I am particularly interested in developing intelligent gameful systems that adapt to user behavior, enhance motivation, and support personalized learning and decision-making.

My work focuses on the following areas:

- **Adaptive Gamification**
- **Cognitive Diagnosis and Knowledge Tracing**
- **Recommender Systems**
- **Data Mining with Large Language Models (LLMs)**

### Education

- **MSc in Computer Science** (2024) - University of Udine, Italy
- **BSc in Computer Science** (2021) - University of Udine, Italy
