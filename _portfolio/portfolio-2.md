## Part 1: Reflection and Discussion

The first part aims to offer food for thought and guide discussion on topics such as:

- **The ethics of computer science** (what it is and why it matters)
- **The ethical responsibility of computing professionals**
- **The lack of these topics in CS Education** (both in Italy and abroad)

## Part 2: Integration Approaches and Case Study

The second part presents **three possible approaches** for integrating ethics into computer science teaching, along with a **case study**.

Slides (in Italian Language) are available [here](/files/Ethics_in_CS_Education.pdf).
