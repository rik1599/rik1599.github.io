On this site, students enrolled in the ECDL courses organized by **ISIS della Bassa Friulana** can:

1. **Book exams**
2. **View**:
   - Exams they have taken (including the grade)
   - Active bookings
   - Their academic progress

To upload exam grades, there is a script that extracts the scores from an Excel file automatically generated by the exam system (managed by **AICA**).

The site has replaced the old booking system (in which students booked exams by sending an email to the teacher), is still in use today, and can be visited at: [https://ecdl.malignani.org/](https://ecdl.malignani.org/)
The site is built with **PHP** and uses the **MySQL** database. It is hosted on a **Linux** server with **Apache**.
