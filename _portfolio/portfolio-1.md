In response to the growing global emphasis on sustainable living and smart cities, multiple initiatives leveraging cutting-edge technologies like Artificial Intelligence and Social Computing have been introduced by governments and corporations.

Within this framework, the MoDiS Research Unit at the Fondazione Bruno Kessler in Trento has developed ‘Play&Go’, an innovative and automated system designed to set sustainable mobility goals for users.

This thesis presents the development and implementation of a recommendation model powered by
a custom adaptation of a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM). We leverage the data from the
‘Play&Go’ database into textual prompts to perform an ad-hoc finetuning of the LLM, by setting the model’s objective to predict the likelihood of users accomplishing a set of sustainability goals based on their history of achieving previous objectives. Our approach has been evaluated against other state-of-the-art models in various scenarios. Results show that LLMs are effective in performing effective recommendations in a gamified urban mobility setting.
